# Exercism Ruby Solutions

Documenting solution submissions to Exercism.io's Ruby track exercises. They use a TDD approach using "minitest" where they require you to pass a number of tests to solve their problems. The solutions are then reviewed by mentors and if they look good, you unlock new exercises, otherwise you may be asked to refactor or tweak your approach.

To run their tests, clone this repo and simply type `ruby name_of_test.rb` in your command line.
